# "Pacman lite game" 
- Game will be created using HTML, css, Javascript and canvas 
-Game will start when players hits the "play game button"
- Player should be able to move with arrow keys (or WASD keys)
- Player should NOT be able to collide with walls 
- Players should be able to collide with 'food' pieces on the board
- foods eatten should increase points
- Goal of game is to eat all the food of the board WITHOUT dying (players will start with 3? lives) 
- Players should be able to collide with ghost however, collision should lead to death and a lost of life 
- Players lose if a ghost collides with them 
- game over screen shall display with game over message with total points obtained 
- Ghost AI should have a random path 
- ghost should NOT be able to touch walls  as well and should be able to collide with player 
- *(Maybe) Super food will spawn randomly on board - should be eatable which will result in ghost being able to be eatten (if so, ghost should respond in a set time)* 
- If all food is gone, player wins, ghost disappear 
- game over - Gameover screen should display total points player has
- There should be a play again button as well displayed with gameover screen if player wishes to play again
